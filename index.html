      My favorite thing about programming is being able to have so much creative freedom. There is a lot to be created and it is all at our finger tips!

    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      I wasn't always going to do tech related stuff. I started out pre-law and was in the process of applying to law schools, when I realized I did not want to go. After a lot of consideration and talking to software engineer friends, I decided to see if coding was for me. I taught myself the basics of HTML and now have decided a bootcamp will give me enough structure to accomplish what I want. It is exciting to know I will be able to create a lot of things I've planned before in my head.
